# EDA Report – CO2 Emissions Project

## Key Findings
- Engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption show strong positive correlation with CO₂ emissions.
- Distribution:
  - Engine size: mostly between 2–4 L
  - Cylinders: mostly 4–8
  - Fuel consumption: normal distribution
  - CO₂ emissions: normal distribution
- No major outliers requiring removal.
- Strong linear trend between engine size & CO₂ emissions.

## Plots Generated
- Histograms for engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO₂.
- Correlation heatmap.
- Scatter plots of engine size vs CO₂ emissions.
