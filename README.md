# 🚗 CO₂ Emissions Regression Project

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **vehicle CO₂ emissions (g/km)** based on engine specifications, fuel consumption, and vehicle characteristics.  
It uses machine learning regression techniques to analyze and model the relationship between vehicle features and CO₂ emissions.  

Dataset includes columns:
- Make, Model, Vehicle Class
- Engine Size (L), Cylinders, Transmission, Fuel Type
- Fuel Consumption (City, Hwy, Comb)
- CO₂ Emissions (Target)
